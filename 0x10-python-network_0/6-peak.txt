The time complexity of the `find_peak` function implemented in `6-peak.py` is O(log(n)).

Explanation:
- The function uses a modified binary search algorithm to find a peak in an unsorted list of integers.
- Binary search has a time complexity of O(log(n)), where n is the number of elements in the list.
- In each iteration of the binary search, the search space is halved, leading to a logarithmic time complexity.
